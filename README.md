# NetworkManagment
Hi, in this project of Network Managment I have done some hands-on-practice with the server and the mailing part.
Here I have learnt how to create your own domain and how to run it on server.
Also I have learnt the mail transferring protocols and have also set up my own server.
From the above PPT you will get to know about each and step which I have performed to make the server.
You'll better understand about my project if you'll just have a quick review.
Thankyou for showing interest.
